OOPS concept

1. Abstraction

* "Abstraction‚Äù, in general words, is the process of working with ideas rather than their implementation.
* Abstraction is a process of providing functionality to the users by hiding its implementation details from them. In other words, the user will have just the knowledge of what an entity is doing instead of its internal working.
--------------------------------
Advantages of Java Abstraction
--------------------------------
1. Reduce the complexity.
2. Avoid the code dupication.
3. Eases the burden of maintenance.
4. Increase security and confidentiality.
------------------------***********--------------------------

2. Encapsulation
-----------------
* Encapsulation, in general, is the action of enclosing or binding something. In OOP it is a way of combining both data and functions that operate on that data, into a single unit.
* In other words, we can define it as Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data and functions (methods that operate on the data) into a single unit (called class).
--------------------------------
Advantages of Java Encapsulation
--------------------------------
1. Data Hiding
2. Getter and Setter Methods
3. Flexibility and Maintainability
4. Code Reusability 
5. Total Control
6. Ease of Testing
------------------------***********--------------------------

3. Inheritance
---------------
The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also
--------------------------------
Advantages of Java Inheritance
--------------------------------

1. Reusability. -- facility to use public methods of base class without rewriting the same
2. Extensibility -- extending the base class logic as per business logic of the derived class
3. Data hiding -- base class can decide to keep some data private so that it cannot be altered by the derived class

4. Overriding--With inheritance, we will be able to override the methods of the base class so that meaningful  implementation of the base class method can be designed in the derived class.
------------------------***********--------------------------

4. Polymorphism
----------------
* Polymorphism is the ability for a data or message to be processed in more than one form. It is a concept by which a single operation can be performed in multiple different ways.
--------------------------------
Advantages of Java Polymorphism
--------------------------------
1. Polymorphism allows a superclass to define methods that are common to all of its derived classes while allowing subclasses to specify the additional implementation of some or all of those methods.
2. Method Overriding is supported by Dynamic Polymorphism which is a key aspect of dynamic binding or run-time polymorphism.
3. Polymorphism provides the ability to a method to do different things on the basis of the object upon which it is acting.
4. Easy to debug the codes.
5. It helps the programmer to reuse the codes, i.e., classes once written, tested and implemented can be reused as required. Saves a lot of time.
6. Single variable can be used to store multiple data types.
